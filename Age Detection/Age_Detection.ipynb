For this purpose, we're going to use Keras, pandas, numpy and convolutional neural network. The dataset we are going to use contains images of over 100 India actors and actresses, which is collected from more than 100 videos. All the images are cropped from the video frames resulting in a high degree of variability in terms of scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, resolution, occlusion, and makeup.\n",
